Hi there! I'm Antonio. I'm a 22-year-old game programmer from Germany. Ever since I first played Crash Bandicoot on PlayStation 1, my dream was to become a game developer and work for Naughty Dog, the company which made me fall in love with video games. I want to use this blog to share my journey with other developers and talk about new things I learn.
