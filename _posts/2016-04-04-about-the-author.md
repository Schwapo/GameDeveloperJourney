Hey, my name is Antonio A. I'm a 22-year-old programmer that lives in Germany since I was 10 years old I dreamed about being a game programmer at a big company like Naughty Dog. Becoming a good game programmer is no small task and I decided to document my further journey in hopes that others could learn from it and to have a roadmap from dream to reality. There are three major things that I want to specifically talk about on my journey that are closely related to Game Development. First Mathematics, mathematics was never my strong suit, but I know (and hopefully you do too) that you can become good at anything if you overcome the first steps of fear to fail. Secondly, I want to write about programming, obviously to become a game programmer you have to learn to program, and although I can already program in multiple languages I would like to strengthen my understanding of the fundamentals and learn new things on the way to total comprehension. And lastly, I want to talk about the Unity3D Game Engine which is the engine I will be using to make games with. I want to share new and interesting tips and tricks I learned so that anybody can benefit from them. Since Unity3D uses C# as its primary scripting language I will be using mostly C# in all my examples.
